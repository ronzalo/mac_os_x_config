                    <p>
                        XML files are, by definition, text files yet they represent hierarchical data. Running
                        a text comparison on XML files will often suffice, however at times the results
                        might not be what you'd expected. For instance, two XML files with logically identical
                        content will be reported as different by the text comparison engine when they have
                        elements with differently ordered attributes, or when their formatting is different.
                        Designed to be human-readable, XML data are often computer-generated and many XML
                        generators are clueless about formatting and attribute ordering.

                        hardly be overstated. Leveraging the familiar file-system browser metaphor, DeltaWalker
                        encourages you to see both the forest and the trees. Browse through your folder
                        comparison results and when a file stops your attention - double click it and DeltaWalker
                        will open it for comparison just below the folder comparison window (default position).
                        It's that intuitive.</p>

                        the folder comparison one to an icon in a toolbar alongside the application window
                        (e.g. left side):.</p>

                        Inherently Unicode-based, DeltaWalker is able to detect the character encoding of
                        many, but not all, text files. Unicode encodings are typically easy to detect, thanks
                        to a two-byte leading identifier, while SBCS don't lend themselves well for auto-detection.
                        If a character encoding is detected incorrectly many, or all, characters would appear
                        garbled, or unreadable.</p>
                    <p>
                        In case DeltaWalker is unable to correctly detect the character encoding of a file,
                        you can easily select in from one of several places:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The Select File dialog, when selecting the file to open.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>The Set Encoding dialog, after the file has been opened for comparison.</li>
                        <li>The Save File dialog, in case you want to change the character encoding of a file
                            just before saving it.</li>
                        <li>The <strong>Editing</strong> preference page allows you to select the default encoding
                            - language, or character set - for new text files created in DeltaWalker.</li>
                    </ul>

                        As with character encoding, DeltaWalker facilitates changing the line delimiters
                        of a text file in just the right moments and places:</p>
                    <ul>

                        <li>The <strong>File &gt; Convert Line Delimiters To...</strong> menu items.</li>
                        <li>The Save File dialog, in case you want to change the line delimiters of a file just
                            before saving.</li>
                        <li>The <strong>Editing</strong> preference page allows you to select the default line
                            delimiter for new text files.</li>
