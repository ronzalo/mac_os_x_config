1) Unit Testing deals with tests on models.
2) Controllers are tested via Functional Testing
3) Integration Testing focuses on the testing of the interation between controllers

Rails has a number of features that make it easy to test your application. In particular, Rails uses a separate runtime database dedicated to testing and can automatically populate the test database with fresh sample data (that you provide) before each test.

This is how you execute the tests :-

a) Test all units and functionals
rake test

b) Run tests for functionals  (test controllers)
rake test:functionals
Ex: running a specific test

$ rake test:functionals TEST=test/functional/admin/events_controller_test.rb


c) Run tests for integration
rake test:integration

d) Run tests for units (test models)
rake test:units
