Git flow of controll ala Pascal

    The idea behind a rebase is to pull a branch up to HEAD so that it'll merge cleaning (in fact it'll just do a fast-foward instead of a merge)

    For multiple people working on the same repo, I've attached 3 scripts that someone sent me last week that I really like:

    $ hack "branchname"
    # creates a new branch of off master

    $ sink
    # rebases your current branch to be up to date with master, so it'll merge cleanly

    $ ship
    # does a squash commit, merging all the features of that branch into master into a single commit and pushing to origin

    So a standard collaborative workflow would be:

    Fork via github
    hack my-feature
      # write code
      git commit . -m 'Commit message'
      .. repeat ..
    sink
    ship

    Then you'll have 1 new commit off of master that you can create a pull request with


    git remote -v

================================================================
        To work with remote designer
================================================================
Initialize Project:
- Destroy App on Heroku (under My Apps)
- Destroy Dir & Staging locally (within Documents\GitHub)
- Delete repository in GitHub.com on Volumesquared (within Admin tab)
- Stop tracking all repository in GitHub app [unexpected behavior]
***********************************
Make my changes locally and testing on Heroku.com:
- Fork Charles' repository on GitHub.com
- Once forked, I need to "clone in windows" to bring it locally to my computer
- Set up App on Heroku via Shell
- $ heroku create feewise-volumesquared (which creates a space on Heroku.com)
- Make a change on local files
- $ git status
- $ git add .
- $ git status
- $ git commit -a -m"notes on change"
- $ git push heroku master
- $ heroku ps
- $ heroku run rake db:migrate (Only need to do it once after a fork)
- $ heroku logs (to double check the completed process)
- $ heroku open (to check changes in browser)
***********************************
Close the loop with Charles on GitHub.com:
- Use GitHub Windows App to sync
- Once synced with VS account, please go and make a pull request for Charles
