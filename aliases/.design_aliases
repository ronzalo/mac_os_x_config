The web site idea is awesome.  It's interesting enough that people use it.  Good stuff!  Many of the web sites I toy around with on the side fall flat.  This is a solid idea that I would be proud to show off as a web portfolio.

Don't forget to validate your HTML:  http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dropmeawhine.com%2F&charset=(detect+automatically)&doctype=Inline&group=0

Change the title of your page.  The title is what shows up in a Google search and it should describe your site better.
Consider b!tch instead of b*tch.

I'd suggest installing Google Analytics.  I'd be glad to help you through this process if it's your first time.  It's a lot of fun to see traffic coming to your site; I find Google Analytics a good morale booster! :)

This is a good tool for testing how your web site looks in different browsers:  http://browsershots.org/  Keep in mind that the usage is throttled (you may only be able to use this service once a day) and that you probably want to install Google Analytics after you've got your site design down.  Otherwise, browsershots.org will generate a lot of hits to your site and Google Analytics will look like you had a lot of traffic when in fact you were just testing it.

If you want to drive more traffic to your web site, post it on Reddit (but make it prettier first).  If you aren't that familiar with Reddit, let me give you a few tips before posting there because it has its own "culture".  Reddit is a great way to get your app exposed to the general public and a great way to get unbiased, unwhitewashed feedback about your site.

Create a twitter account and add a link to the site.  It's especially important to do this before you send lots of traffic to the site.  That way, if people are interested in the site, they'll follow you on Twitter.  Then if you add significant functionality to the site you can send out a tweet and people will come back.  Also, having a presence on twitter will send a slow trickle of traffic to your web site.

One of your biggest needs right now, in my opinion, is to make your site prettier.  I am both a good and a bad source of advice for this.  Good in that my mother is a professional visual artist and I inherited some of her skills so I have some level of basic skills in the visual arts.  Bad in that I haven't practiced these skills, so I'm nowhere near what professional web designers can do.  There is a lot to talk about with design, so I'll just mention some things that jump out at me right away:  color, visual hierarchy, font, and copy.  The layout, organization, and usability seem pretty solid to me.  Let me know if you want us to go into a more detailed discussion about design.
